#### An app which allows the user to select the location of themself and a friend, then calculates a middle point between them to meet up based on their respective commute times and makes recommendations as to bars, restaurants and other attractions to visit.

### Introduction

This is my own fork of our final group project at Makers Academy.  6 of us made this over our final 2 weeks, but this fork is for my own personal improvements post-course.

### To use the app:

Locally:
#### Set up the backend Rails API in a terminal:

 1. `git clone https://github.com/Timdavidcole/meet-in-the-middle-backend-api.git`  
 2. `bundle install`  
 3. `rails db:create`  
 4. `rails db:migrate`  
 5. `rails s -p 3001`  
 
 #### Set up the React front end:
 
 1. `git clone git@github.com:gennyallcroft/meet-in-the-middle-react-front-end.git`
 2. `cd meet-in-the-middle-react-front=end`
 3. `npm install`
 4. `npm start`
 
 - Unfortunately because our API calls are in the front end you have to open Chrome without CORS enabled.
 
 5. `open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security`
 6. In the new chrome browser window go to http://localhost:3000/
 
#### Deployed:

 http://meet-in-the-middle-frontend.herokuapp.com/
 
 ### How to run the tests:
 
 #### Backend
 1. `RSpec`
 
 #### Front end
 1. `npm start`
 2. `npx open cypress`
 
 ### Approach to the project:
 
 

 ### Tech stack:
 
 Rails API  
 React  
 PostgreSQL  
 
 Cypress  
 RSpec  
 Jest  
 Travis CI  

 
### Troubleshooting  

Should you have any trouble running the app in your browser, run the following in your terminal which will open a new Chrome browser:  
```open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security```
